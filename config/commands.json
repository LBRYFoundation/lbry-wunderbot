The LBRY app, which is built on the LBRY protocol, allows creators to broadcast their content via the LBRY blockchain to anyone using a connected app or website, so it can be downloaded or advertised; a little like how BitTorrent works. Using the app or API, you can set a price for your content or give it away for free, like you do on YouTube but without the ads. It benefits the user because there's no ads and content isn't shaped or removed to fit a political narrative. For content creators there's no risk of demonetization and legal content can't be censored or removed. You can find out more on the [FAQ](https://lbry.com/faq), or ask anyone here for their experience!",
